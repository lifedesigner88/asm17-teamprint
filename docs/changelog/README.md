# Changelog Index

## Structure

- Daily change records are added as `docs/changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- The initial accumulated log is preserved in [2026-03-09.md](2026-03-09.md).

## Operating Rules

### 1. Daily file first

- All changelog entries go into the file for that day first.
- When starting new work, check if the file for that date exists; create it if not.

### 2. During work: short memo only

- While working, accumulate changes as one-line notes only.
- At this stage, complete tracking matters more than polished sentences.
- Minor experiments, reverted attempts, and temporary diagnostics can also be noted briefly.

### 3. Before commit: rewrite by commit bundle

- Before committing, do not leave the day's notes as-is.
- Select only the changes that will actually go into this commit and summarize them.
- Prioritize "learning order" and "intent of change" over "chronological listing".
- Use this compact structure where possible:
  - `Day Summary`
  - `Recommended Reading Order`
  - Per major step: `What Changed / Why It Mattered / Files To Read`
  - `End-of-Day Result`
- `Representative Commits` is optional. Include it only when it helps connect the changelog to the actual commit bundle.
- For dense workdays, compress the day into `3~5` major bundles instead of listing every small adjustment.
- The goal is not completeness by default. The goal is fast review later.

### 4. After commit: keep only durable summary

- After committing, remove sentences that were just interim notes.
- Keep only the final summary that matches the commit history.
- Remove replaced temporary notes, duplicate sentences, and miscellaneous experiment records.
- If the file still feels long, compress again until the major learning steps are easy to scan in one pass.

### 5. Relationship to git history

- The changelog is not a copy of `git log`.
- If multiple commits form one learning step, group them into one section.
- Conversely, even a single large commit can be split into multiple sections if it has multiple learning points.
- The key question is: "Is this easy to understand when studying the commits later?"

### 6. Scope discipline

- The changelog captures project-wide operational, structural, and feature changes.
- Detailed API specs are not written at length in the changelog.
- Endpoint details belong in the code, OpenAPI, or separate test/doc files.
